// View: Class that has all the code to show the app interface to the user and get their responses. Upon receiving a response View alerts the Presenter.

// Presenter: Nucleus of a module. It gets user response from the View and works accordingly. The only class to communicate with all the other components. Calls the router for wire-framing, Interactor to fetch data (network calls or local data calls), view to update the UI.
// Interactor: Has the business logic of an app. e.g if business logic depends on making network calls then it is Interactorâ€™s responsibility to do so.
// Router: Does the wire-framing. Listens from the presenter about which screen to present and executes that.

// Entity: Contains plain model classes used by the Interactor. Below shows a simple diagram of VIPER
